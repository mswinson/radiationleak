radiationleak
=============


Radiation Leak is a game I wrote for the Amstrad CPC 
back in the 80s.

Radiation Leak is basically a clone/inspired by games such as 
Boulderdash in which the goal is to navigate a cave full of 
radioactive waste containers, treating each container before
heading to the exit to proceed to the next level.

Hazards include the many rocks distributed throughout each cave.
You need to avoid either being crushed by a rock fall or having a rock
fall obstruct your route. There is also a time limit within
which you must complete the cave.
